# cervical cancer classifier 
## Problem
Cervical cancer is one of the dangerous and deadly cancer, which is considered the fourth frequent with more than 500,000 case in 2018 according to WHO. the early diagnosing for the cancer along with the access to the correct and efficient treatment have a significant positive impact on the patient. This project aims to develop a high accuracy classifier which will be using a dataset for more than 850 different case positively and negatively diagnosed with the cervical cancer as helping tool to predict the cancer in early stage. 
The stages to create the classifier will start by obtaining the dataset form [this link]( https://datahub.io/machine-learning/cervical-cancer)    , followed by processing the data and cleaning it by replacing the Nan values and the unnecessary attributes  , visualizing  the  data with the correct visual representation , stating a null hypothesis . 
In stage two the null hypothesis will be tested, the classifier will be trained and tested against the dataset. applying different classification algorithms to find the most suitable accuracy. Investigating the usually classification problems such as overfitting, imbalanced data, biased data

## Data 
The dataset is available for public use from the mentioned link,according to UCI“The dataset was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela.” .the dataset description is as the following, the data contains 858 samples and 32 attributes as well as four class (Hinselmann, Schiller, Cytology and Biopsy). The same data set had been used by (Choudhury & Won, 2018) by using the Biopsy class as the targeted  value  the aim is to use the other classes .The missing data almost 13.2% from the total data. the data’s features and type showed in table one (Choudhury & Won, 2018)
