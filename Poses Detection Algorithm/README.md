# Poses Detection Algorithm
## Brief description
This project is a Poses Detection application where a user can provide a query pose image and the application returns similar pose frames from a video or from  images in a dataset. You can test the code with this [dataset] (https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pose/)
