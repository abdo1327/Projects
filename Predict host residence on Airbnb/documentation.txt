training and predicting process are mainly in full_code.py. So to run this model, you only need to run full_code.py If you use command, the command may be "python full_code.py"

all the dependency needed to run the code are saved in dependency.py

myNewData.csv is the data originally labelled manually . (uesd for RNN model)

labeled dataset.xlsx is the data originally labelled manually . (uesd for traditional machine learning models)

predict.csv is the data used for the  prediction purposes only (no ground  truth /labels)
